First, determine: Is this an actual painting, sculpture, or famous artwork photograph?
- If NO (it's a selfie, person photo, random image, digital art, etc.) ‚Üí Return the "not a famous artwork" response
- If YES, and you can identify it with certainty ‚Üí Return the success response

        Vincent van Gogh painted "The Starry Night" in 1889 while staying at an asylum in Saint-R√©my-de-Provence, France. This iconic masterpiece captures a swirling night sky ablaze with movement and emotion, reflecting van Gogh's turbulent inner world.

        The painting features bold, expressive brushstrokes that create a sense of motion and energy. The cypress tree in the foreground reaches toward the sky like a dark flame, symbolizing the connection between earth and heaven. The village below remains peaceful and still, contrasting with the dynamic cosmos above.

        Van Gogh used vivid blues and yellows to create dramatic contrast and emotional intensity. The swirling patterns in the sky suggest both beauty and chaos, reflecting the artist's struggle with mental illness while celebrating the wonder of nature.

        This Post-Impressionist work broke traditional rules of perspective and color, paving the way for modern art. Van Gogh painted from memory and imagination rather than direct observation, infusing the scene with his unique vision and passion. Today, it remains one of the most recognized and beloved paintings in the world.

        'Mona Lisa': '''
        Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa," painted between 1503-1519, is arguably the world's most famous painting. This Renaissance masterpiece portrays Lisa Gherardini, a Florentine merchant's wife, with an enigmatic expression that has captivated viewers for centuries.

        Da Vinci employed sfumato, a technique of subtle gradations between colors without harsh outlines, creating an almost ethereal quality. The painting's mysterious smile seems to change depending on where you look ‚Äì a result of Leonardo's understanding of optics and human perception.

        The background landscape features winding paths and distant mountains, painted in atmospheric perspective that adds depth and mystery. Leonardo worked on this portrait for years, continuously refining it and considering it his favorite work.

        The Mona Lisa revolutionized portraiture by depicting the subject in a three-quarter view with hands visible, creating a more intimate and lifelike representation. Her direct gaze engages viewers, making them feel personally connected to the painting across five centuries.

            'biography': '''Vincent Willem van Gogh was born in 1853 in the Netherlands and became one of the most influential figures in Western art history, despite selling only one painting during his lifetime. His journey into art began relatively late at age 27, after unsuccessful careers as an art dealer and missionary.

Van Gogh struggled with mental illness throughout his adult life, experiencing severe depression and psychotic episodes. These challenges deeply influenced his work, infusing his paintings with raw emotion and intensity. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including the asylum in Saint-R√©my where he created many masterpieces.

His artistic career lasted only a decade (1880-1890), but during this time he produced over 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings. Van Gogh developed a unique style characterized by bold colors, emotional honesty, and dramatic brushwork that laid the groundwork for Expressionism.

Tragically, Van Gogh died at 37 from a gunshot wound, likely self-inflicted. His brother Theo was his greatest supporter, both emotionally and financially. Today, Van Gogh's work sells for millions and his story of perseverance through adversity inspires artists worldwide.''',
            'style': '''Van Gogh's style evolved from dark, earthy tones to the vibrant, expressive palette he's famous for today. He employed thick, visible brushstrokes (impasto technique) that created texture and movement, making his paintings come alive with energy.

His use of color was revolutionary - he used complementary colors (like blue and orange) to create vibrancy and emotional intensity. Swirling, dynamic compositions characterized his later work, expressing psychological turbulence and spiritual transcendence.

Van Gogh was influenced by Japanese woodblock prints, which inspired his bold outlines and flat color areas. He often painted outdoors (en plein air) to capture the changing light and atmosphere, working quickly to preserve spontaneity and emotion.''',

                'Wheatfield with Crows (1890)'
            ],
            'influences': '''Van Gogh was profoundly influenced by French Impressionists like Claude Monet, Japanese ukiyo-e prints, and the peasant paintings of Jean-Fran√ßois Millet. His emotional intensity and expressive use of color directly inspired the Fauvists and German Expressionists.

His legacy extends beyond painting - his letters to his brother Theo provide invaluable insights into the creative process. Van Gogh proved that art could express the deepest human emotions, making him a symbol of the tortured genius and the transformative power of perseverance. His impact on modern art cannot be overstated.'''

            'biography': '''Leonardo da Vinci, born in 1452 in Vinci, Italy, epitomizes the Renaissance ideal of the "universal man" - excelling as a painter, scientist, engineer, and inventor. Apprenticed to the artist Verrocchio in Florence, Leonardo's talent quickly surpassed his master's.

Throughout his life, Leonardo served various patrons including the Medici family, Ludovico Sforza of Milan, and King Francis I of France. His insatiable curiosity led him to study anatomy, engineering, geology, and botany, filling thousands of notebook pages with observations and inventions centuries ahead of their time.

Despite his genius, Leonardo was notoriously slow to complete paintings, often leaving works unfinished as new ideas captured his attention. He spent his final years in France as a guest of King Francis I, continuing his scientific studies until his death in 1519.

His influence on art and science remains unparalleled. Leonardo's systematic approach to studying nature and his integration of art and science established new standards that still inspire today.''',
            'style': '''Leonardo pioneered sfumato, a technique of subtle, almost imperceptible transitions between colors and tones, creating soft, atmospheric effects. This gave his portraits an unprecedented lifelike quality and psychological depth.

His mastery of perspective, anatomy, and light was unmatched. Leonardo studied human corpses to understand muscle structure, bone placement, and movement, enabling him to depict the human form with scientific accuracy infused with grace and beauty.

He emphasized the importance of observing nature directly, sketching from life to capture authentic detail. His paintings demonstrate perfect balance between realism and idealization, technical precision and emotional expression, making them eternally captivating.''',

                'Salvator Mundi (c. 1500)'
            ],
            'influences': '''Leonardo was influenced by his teacher Verrocchio, ancient Roman art, and the mathematical principles of perspective developed by Brunelleschi. His scientific method and artistic innovations profoundly influenced High Renaissance masters like Raphael and Michelangelo.

His notebooks, containing revolutionary concepts for flying machines, hydraulics, and anatomy, demonstrated the power of observational science. Leonardo showed that art and science are inseparable, establishing a legacy that continues to inspire interdisciplinary thinking and innovation across all fields of human endeavor.'''
